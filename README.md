# Bullet Drop Script for Roblox Musket System

## Description
This script implements a realistic bullet drop mechanic for a musket system in Roblox. It simulates gravity, air drag, and air friction to create a more immersive projectile trajectory. The script is designed for educational and personal use only.

## Features
- **Gravity Simulation**: Bullets are affected by gravity, creating a realistic arc.
- **Air Drag and Friction**: Simulates the effects of air resistance on the bullet's velocity.
- **Collision Handling**: Stops the bullet's simulation upon collision with objects.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily adjust gravity, drag, and initial velocity to fit your game.

## Usage
1. Copy the script into your Roblox project.
2. Attach it to your musket or gun system.
3. Customize the parameters (e.g., gravity, drag, velocity) to suit your needs.

### Example Parameters
- `bullet:SetGravity(9.81)` - Adjust gravity to simulate bullet drop.
- `bullet:SetDrag(0.3)` - Modify drag to control air resistance.
- `bullet:SetVelocity(gun:GetForwardVector() * 1000)` - Set the initial speed of the bullet.
